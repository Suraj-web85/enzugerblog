            <h4>Information Covered by this Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to personal information as provided by
              you and which are collected by the website. Personal information
              is information related to an individual, or a combination of
              pieces of information that could reasonably allow an individual to
              be identified. Personal information may consist of full name,
              personal contact numbers, residential address, your or your
              relative’s photograph, email address, gender, date of birth and
              any such personal information an individual may provide in this
              website. While information such as date of birth in isolation may
              not be enough to uniquely identify an individual, a combination of
              full name and date of birth may be sufficient to do so.
            </p>
            <p>

              is collected, received, stored, transmitted or processed by EIPL,
